Demo-2 Digital clock

In this demo, we will have some knowledge about the `collision` which is a important system to make our animation alive
skill points:

1. `arc(x,y,r,beginAngle,endAngle)` to draw a circle

2. update function : `requestAnimationFrame`, you also can check the details from MDN about this function. this function could try it best to run the function every 16ms (around) to make the animation to be like 60Hz.
